## Course Description

This course is designed for AI developers aiming to build cutting-edge Generative AI (GenAI) applications. Focusing on the applied side of AI, students will explore key techniques such as in-context learning (ICL), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), AI agents, and responsible AI principles. The course covers advanced tools and methods, including embedding models, inference optimizations (e.g., quantization, multi-adapter swapping), fine-tuning of pre-trained models and benchmarking LLMs. Students will gain hands-on experience with open-source tools like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and platforms such as AWS, applying their skills in practical GenAI applications. The course culminates in a capstone project, preparing participants to deploy scalable, optimized AI systems in real-world scenarios. This course bridges the gap between data science knowledge and applied AI development, empowering students to solve industry-level challenges.

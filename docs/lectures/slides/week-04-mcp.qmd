## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### Overview

- **What is MCP?**: A protocol for connecting AI models with external tools and data sources
- **Why MCP?**: Standardize how AI agents interact with tools, APIs, and services
- **Key Benefits**:
  - Tool integration framework
  - Consistent interface for AI-tool communication
  - Secure and scalable architecture

## MCP Architecture

### Core Components

- **MCP Server**: Exposes tools and resources to AI models
- **MCP Client**: Consumes MCP servers (typically an AI agent/application)
- **Protocol**: JSON-RPC based communication
- **Transport**: Multiple transport options (stdio, HTTP, WebSocket)

## Building MCP Servers

### Key Concepts

- **Tools**: Functions that the AI can call
- **Resources**: Data sources the AI can access
- **Prompts**: Pre-defined prompt templates
- **Authentication**: Securing MCP servers

## MCP Server Examples

### Common Use Cases

- **API Wrappers**: Wrapping external APIs as MCP tools
- **Database Connections**: Querying databases via MCP
- **File System Access**: Safe file operations
- **Custom Business Logic**: Domain-specific tools

## Deployment Patterns

### Local vs Remote

- **Local MCP Servers**: Running on the same machine as the client
- **Remote MCP Servers**: Deployed as cloud services
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Mix of local and remote servers

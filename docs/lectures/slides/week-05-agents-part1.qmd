## Need for Agents

- In-context learning alone is not sufficient
  - Limited to input token size
  - No ability to retain context beyond a single session
- Why RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is not sufficient
  - Primarily enhances knowledge retrieval
  - Lacks decision-making and action-taking capabilities
- Agents extend LLMs by enabling them to interact with external tools and maintain long-term context

## Tool Usage and Function Calling

- Agents leverage tool usage (aka function calling) to interact with external systems
- Function calling allows LLMs to:
  - Retrieve real-time data (APIs, databases)
  - Execute operations (calculations, file manipulations, etc.)
  - Make multi-step decisions by chaining function calls

## Introduction to AI Agents

## Short-term vs. Long-term Memory

- **Short-term memory**: Stored during an active session (e.g., chat history)
- **Long-term memory**: Persisted across multiple sessions (e.g., user preferences, embeddings in a vector database)
- Agents utilize memory to enhance contextual understanding and improve decision-making

---

## Maintaining State and Session Information

- Techniques used by agents to manage state:
  - Context window retention (short-term memory)
  - Vector databases for retrieving past interactions
  - External storage (e.g., databases, knowledge graphs)
- Enables multi-tool collaboration and seamless user interactions

---

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

- Agents can work together to solve complex problems
- Examples:
  - One agent retrieves data while another analyzes it
  - Different agents specializing in distinct tasks (e.g., research, summarization, coding)
- Requires a shared state or communication mechanism

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

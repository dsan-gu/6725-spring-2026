## Learning Activities, Communication and Evaluation

This is a hands-on, practical, workshop style course that provides opportunities to use the tools and techniques discussed in class.
Although this is not a programming course per se, but there is lot of programming involved.

### Lectures and Labs

This course is split into a lecture/lab format, where every class session will have a lecture portion, and most sessions will have an in-class lab portion:

-   During the lecture, we will discuss the concepts and techniques for building Gen AI apps on cloud platforms.
-   During the lab sessions, you will be completing exercises and following examples which are designed to show you how to implement the ideas and concepts with various tools. We will start the labs in class but we will not finish. It is your responsibility to complete the labs (**which is part of the grade**) and will enable your learning.

Lectures may not cover all the material and some topics will be introduced in the lab or through readings/assignments.

### Office Hours

Instructors and TAs will hold recurring office hours to answer questions, review material, and support your learning.
The times, dates, and location of office hours will be announced via Canvas and Slack in advance.

### Readings

On certain weeks, readings will be assigned to prepare you for the lecture material being presented.
These readings should take an hour or less per week.

### Online Quizzes

Quizzes will be given a few times during the semester during lab or lecture at random intervals and times.
Quizzes ensure you are keeping up with the material presented in the class.
Quizzes are meant to be brief and low-stress with a time limit of 5-10 minutes.
The material will be drawn from lectures, labs, and readings.

### Lab Deliverables

Each lab will have a deliverable.
It is essential that you learn the skills presented in the labs so that you can effectively complete the assignments and the big data project.
The lab deliverables can sometimes be completed during lab, however, it is your responsibility to complete the deliverable as part of your work outside of lecture/lab time.

### Homework Assignments

You will be several homework assignments for roughly half of the semester.
The goal of these problem sets is to hone your big data skills by answering some questions about large datasets.
The problem sets will build on the labs and will be much more in-depth.
Deliverables from the assignment will usually include code written for your programs and the output produced.

!!! warning "Start early on the assignments"

**Please start assignments as soon as they are posted. These assignments can take several hours to complete depending on your familiarity with the material. You will not complete the assignments on time if you start the day they are due.**

!!! note "Solutions to problem sets"
We reuse problem set questions, we expect students not to copy, refer to, or look at the solutions in preparing their answers.
Since this is a graduate-level class, we expect students to want to learn and not search online for answers.
See Academic Integrity section.

### Capstone project

Details _coming soon_.

## Grading and Evaluation

-   Group project : 40%
-   Assignments : 30%
-   Lab completions : 20%
-   Quizzes : 10%

Total is 100%.
We have no plans to curve the final grade, and the final letter grade will be:

-   A: \>= 92.5
-   A-: 89.5 - 92.49
-   B+: 87.99 - 89.49
-   B: 81.5 - 87.98
-   B-: 79.5 - 81.49


## Submitting your work

### GitHub classroom

We use GitHub Classroom for all class deliverables: assignments, labs, and the final project. Submitting your work is the process of committing your files and results to your local repository **and** then pushing it to GitHub.

#### Use the `final-submission` commit message

When you are ready for your work to be evaluated, you **MUST** use the commit message `final-submission`. If you do not use the commit message `final-submission` we will assume that you are still working in the repository and we will only grade what is present. By submitting that commit message, you are stating that you are finished with the assignment and are ready for feedback.


In case you need to make a correction after your `final-submission` **and** the submission deadline has not yet passed, then you can *amend* your previous commit.  See [amending a commit](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history) for instructions. **Do not change the commit message,** it should continue say "final-submission" after the amend.

!!! warning "No modifications after final-submission"
**No further edits to your GitHub repository are allowed after using the `final-submission` commit message.**

!!! note "How we detect late submissions"
We will use **commit datetime** and **commit message** to assess lateness. 


### Late policy

In lieu of extensions, there is a tiered deduction scale if a deliverable is late. Late penalties only apply to labs and assignments. 

We will assess exceptional circumstances on a case-by-case basis, and only if we are made aware before a deliverable's deadline, not after.

- A late penalty of 10% per day, up to 4 days, will be assessed for assignments and labs that are submitted with a `final-submission` commit message after the deadline. You may still submit a missed lab or assignment up until the last day of class with a maximum possible grade of 60%.
- Missed in-class quizzes cannot be made up and will receive a grade of zero.
- Project deadlines are fixed and have no extensions or late penalty. A missed project deliverable will receive a grade of zero.


## Other course policies

### Attendance and punctuality

Attendance is mandatory and will be taken. Given the technical nature of this course, and the breadth of topics discussed, you are expected to attend each class, to complete all readings, and to participate actively in lectures, discussions and exercises. We understand there may be times you may need to miss class, please inform us in advance if you are not able to attend class for any reason. However, it is up to you to keep up.

### Participation

We love participation. Read. Raise your hand. Ask questions. Make comments. Challenge us. Acknowledge us. If we speak for three hours to a silent classroom, it is a lot more boring and tiring for everyone.

### Laptop and phone use

You must bring your laptop to class to work on labs. No phone use is allowed during lecture. You may use your laptop during lecture to take notes, but please refrain from other activities. We reserve the right to ask you to put your phones and laptops away. You may not use your computer or phone while your peers or guest speakers are presenting.

### Communication and Slack Rules
-   All announcements will be posted on Canvas and Slack
-   Use Slack for any question you may have about the course, about assignments or any technical issue. This way everyone can learn from each others questions. We will be monitoring and providing answers on a regular basis. **Make sure you understand [what is allowed in Slack.](#what-is-allowed)**
-   Individual emails containing any course question that is not personal will not be answered
-   Slack DMs are not to be used **unless** we DM you first and you can respond to our message. Students may not initiate DMs. 
-   Keep an eye on the questions posted in Slack. Use the search function. It's very possible that we have already answered a question, and we reserve the right to point you to the syllabus, previous Slack messages, or other document containing the information requested
-   Assignment, lab and project questions will only be answered on Slack up to 12 hours before something is due

### Open Door Policy

Please approach or get in touch with us if something is not working for you regarding the class, methods, etc. Our pledge to you is to provide the best learning experience possible. If you have any issue please do not wait until the last minute to speak with us. You will find that we are fair, reasonable, and flexible and we care deeply about your learning and success.

 
## Academic Integrity

As a Jesuit, Catholic university, committed to the education of the whole person, Georgetown expects all members of the academic community, students and faculty, to strive for excellence in scholarship and in character.The University spells out the specific minimum standards for academic integrity in its Honor Code, as well as the procedures to be followed if academic dishonesty is suspected.

Over and above the honor code, in this course we will seek to create an engaged and passionate learning environment, characterized by respect and courtesy in both our discourse and our ways of paying attention to one another.

The code of academic integrity applies to all courses at Georgetown University. Please become familiar with the code. All students are expected to maintain the highest level of academic integrity throughout the course of the semester.Please note that acts of academic dishonesty during the course will be prosecuted and harsh penalties may be sought for such acts. Students are responsible for knowing what acts constitute academic dishonesty. The code may be found at [https://bulletin.georgetown.edu/regulations/honor/.](https://bulletin.georgetown.edu/regulations/honor/)

!!! warning "Zero tolerance for lack of academic integrity"
**We have a ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY and students found to be in violation will be reported and penalized. The consequences of any violation may include: additional points penalty, getting a grade of zero, automatically failing the course, and suspension or expulsion from the program.**


### Definition of collaboration

In the spirit of fostering a collective and inclusive learning environment, we acknowledge that you will work and study with your peers. We also acknowledge that you use web resources (code examples specifically), and that in writing a program many of you will most likely use the same libraries, functions and other similar instructions in your scripts. However:

* **You must write your own code.** This will be verified for every assignment against every submission, and any similarity greater than 60% between students on a given assignment will be considered to be unauthorized collaboration.
* **You must do your individual work in your own cloud resources.** This will be verified for every assignment. We know the fingerprint of your cloud account and subscriptions and we can tell.

### What is allowed

* Collaborating with other students during in-class labs to facilitate collective learning
* Using Slack for helping one-another as long as:
    * You do not provide answers directly but only discuss potential approaches
    * You only share up to a few lines of code for everyone's benefit for the resolution of a specific question or issue 
* Using anything (code, resources, tips, approaches, etc.) provided by the instructional team

### What is forbidden

The following actions are **not permitted in any way** and are considered a violation of academic integrity:

* Copying and sharing code _between students_ in **individual** assignments or _across goups_ in the **group project**
* Sharing anything on any individual assignment
* Using code snippets found online (stack overflow, etc.) and not commenting the source
* Plagiarism of any kind
* Using any [Generative Artificial Intelligence](#use-of-generative-ai-tools) tool without acknowledging it
* Using someone else's cloud resources
* Making your private GitHub repos public
* Sharing or posting any course materials anywhere
* Faking or tampering with git commit dates or messages

## Use of Generative AI tools

We recognize the recent availability of very powerful generative AI tools like Chat-GPT, GitHub Copilot, and others. These tools can help us be more effective and we embrace their use.

!!! note "Use of Gen AI tools"
You are allowed to use GAI tools in a _non substantial_ way. 

What does _non substantial_ mean? 

**It means that whatever is generated by GAI must not make up the majority of the work you do.**

Any use of these tools must abide to the following rules:

- You must acknowledge the use of GAI tools
- You must comment which code blocks were generated by GAI
- You must note which written sections were generated by GAI
- If you used a prompt to ask the GAI tool to do something, you must include it


For this course, valid uses of gen-ai can be:

- Generating a code snippet or single function to perform a task. It’s likely you’ll need to modify it anyway
- Commenting code
- Using it as a writing aid (spelling, grammar, word choice, limited phrase translation) on content created by you, not the actual writing. Note: non-native English speakers cannot use gen-ai to fully translate content written in another language.
- Generating visualization starter code (you can accelerate the generation of the starting point, but you still need to customize the viz with all the best practices learned in this course)
 

!!! warning "Academic integrity"
Any deviation from these rules is considered a violation of [academic integrity](#academic-integrity) and will be acted on.

You typically KNOW when you are crossing the line into un-ethical territory. As a general rule, If you feel like you might be crossing a line, then you probably are!

In addition to what we are stating here, please take a look at the [Data Science and Analytics Program’s ChatGPT usage guidelines](https://gu-dsan.github.io/5200-spring-2024/site-page-content/DSAN-ChatGPT-usage-guidelines.pdf).
